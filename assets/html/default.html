        <h2 class="md-display-1"> Hi, I am Andrew, I am currently a lead software engineer for The NEC Group </h2>

        <p>I've worked for the NEC since October 2017, absolutely loving it.</p>

        <p>
            I think the main thing I have learnt at The NEC is that no development life cycle is perfect, you have to actively improve as you find the weaknesses... <br />
            Forget continuous deployment, continuous improvement is what all developers need
            <br />
        </p>
