        <h2 class="md-display-1"> Hi, I am Andrew, I am currently a senior software engineer for Cruise.co.uk </h2>

        <p>I've worked for Cruise since July 2013, it's been a fun journey.</p>

        <p>
            I think the main thing I have learnt at Cruise is that no development life cycle is perfect, you have to actively improve as you find the weaknesses... <br />
            Self improvement is a strong part of the Cruise development ethos.
            <br />
