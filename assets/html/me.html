                    I started making web sites back in 2000 when I was a cute faced 10 year old boy learning the basics of HTML from my brother (who was 13 and learning HTML in school). 
                    <br />
                    I didn't really know what I was doing, I just knew that changing bits of the code (in Notepad on a Windows 95 PC!) would cause the page to change
                    <br />
                    This curiosity lead me down a path of obsession, excitement and ultimately a career.

                    Currently I work for Cruise.co.uk - an International cruise travel agent

                    I was originally hired as a Junior Software Engineer, but as my passion and skill with technology and programming became apparent, I was promoted twice in less than 3 years
                    Junior Software Engineer --> Software Engineer --> Senior Software Engineer
                    <br />
                    After becoming a Senior Software Engineer, I was introduced in to the recruitment process at Cruise, which means I am now heavily involved in the decision making on potential new developers.
                    <br />
                    Cruise is a great place. Working there has taught me some incredibly useful lessons on programming and web development, some of these lessons are:

                        <li>Testing is <em>critical</em> to the development process</li>
                        <li>Always be aware of performance - milliseconds become minutes.</li>
                        <li>Teamwork & communication are very important to successful and efficient development</li>

                    Personally, I think my future lies in the MEAN stack. It's just so fast to develop & test with, no other stack compares.
