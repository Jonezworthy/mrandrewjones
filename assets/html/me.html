                    I started making web sites back in 2000 when I was a baby faced 10 year old boy learning the basics of HTML from my brother (who was 13 and learning HTML in school). 
                    <br />
                    I didn't really know what I was doing, I just knew that changing bits of the code (in Notepad on a Windows 95 PC!) would cause the page to change
                    <br />
                    This curiosity lead me down a path of obsession, excitement and ultimately a career.

                    Currently I work for The NEC Group - a huge exhibition company
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I started working at The NEC in August 2017 as a lead software engineer, it is a fantastic place to work at
                    <br />
                    I was hired to lead the team that focuses on one particular service we provide to our clients, a service we call "Expoware" which is a exhibition ticketing system

                    Personally, I think my future lies with me staying with the MEAN stack. It's just so fast to develop & test with, no other stack compares.
